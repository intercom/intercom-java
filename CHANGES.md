#### Extract Iterator implementation into TypedDataCollection (#247) 
First thing, TypedDataCollection now implements Iterator, it is delegating the hasNext(), next() and remove() methods to a TypedDataCollectionIterator instance. 
Second, I have removed all specific implementations of Iterator from all Collection classes, which were just copy-paste.

#### Update webhook topics and add ping (#245)
Added support for more topics
